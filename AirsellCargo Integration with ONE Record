# AirsellCargo Integration with ONE Record

## Purpose
This module defines how Airsell Cargo logistics workflows align with the IATA ONE Record standard. It supports shipment visibility, data exchange, and operational guidance for freight forwarding.

## Logistics Objects Used
- **Shipment**: Represents the overall cargo movement.
- **Piece**: Individual items within a shipment.
- **TransportSegment**: Movement stages (e.g., truck, air).
- **Location**: Pickup, transit, and delivery points.

## Workflow Overview
1. **Create Shipment LO** via POST with unique URI.
2. **Link Pieces** to Shipment using RDF relationships.
3. **Assign TransportSegment** for each movement phase.
4. **Update Status** using PATCH (e.g., “Ready for Pickup”, “Delivered”).
5. **Retrieve Data** via GET for customer tracking and internal dashboards.

## API Endpoints (Example)
- `POST /shipment`
- `PATCH /shipment/{id}`
- `GET /shipment/{id}`
- `POST /piece`
- `GET /transportsegment/{id}`

## Use Case Example
Shipment from Hargeisa to Nairobi:
- Shipment LO created with URI `https://airsellcargo.com/shipment/12345`
- Linked to 3 Piece LOs
- TransportSegment includes truck (Hargeisa → Berbera) and air (Berbera → Nairobi)
- Status updates pushed to customer via Airsell Cargo app

## Notes
- This module is tested using the NE:ONE server.
- Future versions will support multi-node pub-sub exchange.
- All URIs follow Airsell Cargo’s naming convention for traceability.
