The ONE Record standard allows parties to change or revoke these access rights to their data whenever they wish.</p> <p>Before an organization can access a LogisticsObject of another organization, it needs to be authorized to do so and the server that hosts the logistics objects will determine whether to grant access. Typically, when an participant creates a LogisticsObject and makes it available via its ONE Record API, the IoL participant will share the URI of that LogisticsObject with another IoL participant and grant them access by default.</p> <p>For example, a freight forwarder creates a Shipment, grants read access to an airline, and then sends the URI of the Logistics Object via a ONE Record Notification or other channel to the airline.</p> <p>It might happen that the Airline needs access to additional Logistics objects linked to the Shipment (i.e.: Piece). In this case, the Airline MAY request the access delegation directly from the freight forwarder (Example A1)</p> <p>At this point, only the forwarder and the airline can access this specific LogisticsObjects, but no one else.</p> <p>However, if a ground handling agent (GHA) also needs access to this logistics object, the airline MAY request an access delegation for the GHA (Example A2).</p> <p>If, as in this presented scenario, the airline already has a delegation of access to the logistics object, the concept of Trust Chains takes effect.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The party granting access is referred to as the <code>Delegator</code> and the party receiving access is the <code>Delegate</code>.  The party requesting access is referred to as the <code>Requestor</code>.</p> <p>Guidelines for Access Delegations in ONE Record: - Only the Holder of a Logistics Object MAY delegate access to logistics objects. - Any authenticated User of a Logistics Object CAN request a AccessDelegation on a Logistics Object, which result in a AccessDelegationRequest with the status REQUEST_PENDING. - The implementer of the ONE record server MUST ensure that the requestor gets sufficient access to the resulting AccessDelegationRequest to query the status of the AccessDelegationRequest and revoke the AccessDelegationRequest (see also section on revoking Action Requests - The Holder of a Logistics Object decides about the AccessDelegationRequest and changes the requestor's permissions to a Logistics Object unless there is a business or technical reason to reject it.</p>"},{"location":"API-Security/access-delegations/#request-access-delegation","title":"Request Access Delegation","text":""},{"location":"API-Security/access-delegations/#endpoint","title":"Endpoint","text":"<pre><code> POST {{baseURL}}/access-delegations\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"API-Security/access-delegations/#request","title":"Request","text":"<p>The following HTTP header parameters MUST be present in the request:</p> Header Description Examples Accept The content type that the ONE Record client wants the HTTP response to be formatted in. application/ld+json Content-Type The content type that is contained with the HTTP body.

Once created the Logistics Object is associated with a unique URI that makes the Logistics Object available on the network.</p> <p>Read a Logistics Object - Logistics Objects can be retrieved by calling the URI of that Logistics Object - its Logistics Object URI. Access rights to that Logistics Object URI is managed by the Holder of the Logistics Object.</p> <p>Update a Logistics Object - As a fundamental principle, only the Holder of a Logistics Object can make changes to it. Therefore, changes required by other parties are expressed as <code>Change Requests</code> that needs to be approved and executed by the actual holder.</p> <p>Subscribe to a Logistics Object for updates - Once a Logistics Object has been created, the holder can propose subscriptions to other parties who will then be notified of any changes. Other parties may also request such a subscription at the discretion of the holder.</p> <p>Create Logistics Event linked with Logistics Objects - Logistics Events like \"arrival\", \"acceptance\" etc. are central in the management of logistics and transport. Every participant in the network with sufficient access rights can submit any type of Logistics Event to any published Logistics Object.</p> <p>Read Logistics Event linked to a Logistics Object - Every participant of the network with sufficient permissions, can also query the Logistics Events associated with a Logistics Object.</p> <p>Manage access to a Logistics Object - Another fundamental principle of ONE Record is that only holders of Logistics Objects have fully control access rights to that Logistics Object.

This automatically creates a new version of the Logistics Object.

They are used to represent resources that do not have a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) associated with them. The resource represented by a bNode is also called an anonymous resource. </p> <p>In RDF, a triple consists of a subject, a predicate, and an object.  According to the RDF standard, a bNode can only be used as the subject or object of an RDF triple. When the object of a triple is a bNode, it means that the resource represented by the object has no URI, but still exists as a node in the RDF graph.</p> <p>bNodes are useful in creating RDF data that represents complex relationships between resources. bNodes are typically represented in RDF syntax with an identifier starting with an <code>_:</code> (underscore colon) followed by a unique identifier. For example: _:ded2e183. This allows to reference this bNode in several triples of the same RDF graph.</p> <p>In addition to logistics object types, the ONE Record data model ontology also specifies data classes that can be linked to logistics objects but do not have a publicly accessible URI (cf. Logistics Object URI).</p> <p>For the purpose of serialization, it MUST be ensured that those embedded objects also have a unique id that can be referenced in other requests. In this document, the ids of this embedded objects are called <code>embedded object ids</code> and can differ from Logistics Object URI. The structure of this embedded object id is up to the implementor of the ONE Record server. Nevertheless, it is RECOMMENDED to use the following structure for embedded object ids:</p> <p><code>internal:&lt;uuid5 using the data class name&gt;</code>, e.g. <code>internal:7fc81d1d-6c75-568b-9e47-48c947ed2a07</code> as a result of uuid5(\"8efaab7c-cfd5-11ed-9abe-325096b39f47\", \"value\")</p> <p>Note</p> <p>It MUST be ensured that these embedded object IDs, similar to logistics object URIs, MUST be unique within the domain of the ONE Record server and MUST NOT change during the lifecycle of an embedded object or its parent objects. Not even if the database is exported as an RDF graph and imported into another RDF store. Otherwise, references to these ids could be corrupted, e.g. in ChangeRequests in the AuditTrail of a logistics object.</p> <p>In the context of ONE Record, only logistics objects have public accessible URIs, while other objects, e.g., Value, do not have public accessible URIs but must be linked. Nevertheless, in ONE Record each node MUST have a unique <code>@id</code> within the document that does not change.  If stored in an RDF database/store, this <code>@id</code> MUST also have a global unique identifier within a graph.

However, only the <code>Holder of a LogisticsObject</code> can update the data,  while <code>Users of the LogisticsObject</code> can only request changes following a structure described in this section.</p> <p>Technically, the HTTP PATCH method is used to request an update to a LogisticsObject. According to the W3C HTTP standard, PATCH is used for partial changes to a resource. This differs from the HTTP PUT method, which is used for the complete replacement of a resource.</p> <p>Linked Data PATCH Format</p> <p>Although ONE Record API specification does not put much emphasis on the use of RDF, it is important that the specification of RDF is fully respected to ensure that ONE Record remains compatible with RDF technologies, such as the use of graph queries.</p> <p>W3C has developed the Linked Data PATCH Format for describing changes to Linked Data. It defines a list of operations to be performed against a Linked Data resource, namely the addition or removal of RDF triples in a graph representation of the resource.</p> <p>This Linked Data PATCH Format provides many options for updating RDF but since ONE Record uses JSON-LD as the RDF Serialization, the ONE Record API specification follows the JSON-LD PATCH specification and limits the options for changing Logistics Objects to two actions only: delete and add.</p> <p>The combination of delete and add is equivalent to replace.

Operations are sorted and processed as two groups of (1) delete operations and (2) add operations until all operations are applied, or else the entire update fails. If an error occurs, it is necessary to revert the logistics object back to its previous state before implementing the modification.</li> <li>If a field update fails, the entire Change is unsuccessful. Partial updates MUST NOT be accepted. The ONE Record server MUST use the property hasError of the ChangeRequest to document the errors.</li> <li>If the update is successful, the revision number in a Logistics Object's AuditTrail is incremented and the changes are recorded in the Audit Trail. Please refer to the sections on Historical Logistics Objects and Audit Trail of Logistics Objects for more details.</li> <li>It is RECOMMENDED to get the latest version of Logistics Object before requesting a Change to ensure that the update is made to the latest version of the Logistics Object.</li> <li>If a ChangeRequest is rejected by the Holder of the Logistics Object, the revision number of the Logistics Object is not incremented but the request is added to the AuditTrail of this Logistics Object, marked with the status REQUEST_REJECTED. A rejected ChangeRequest is kept in the AuditTrail of the Logistics Object.</li> <li>After a ChangeRequest is accepted, other pending ChangeRequests that affect the same revision MUST be rejected.</li> <li>The PATCH operation MUST NOT be used to create logistics objects; only linking to an existing object is allowed in a ChangeRequest.</li> <li>The PATCH operation MUST NOT be used to link a LogisticsEvent to a Logistics Object. The ONE Record server MUST reject requested changes that contain operations to the hasLogisticsEvent property.</li> <li>The ONE Record server MUST check that the property referencesLogisticsObject matches the URI/endpoint used for the PATCH request. </li> <li>If datatype in OperationObject is an IRI of the ONE Record cargo ontology and is not a data class that inherits from LogisticsObject, then the ONE Record Server MUST generate an embeddedObjectId for the object in the <code>value</code> property of <code>OperationObject</code> (see section about Blank Nodes and Embedded Objects)</li> </ul> <p>Logistics Objects MUST have a revision number, which is a non negative integer to be incremented after every applied change.

The next sections provide more detailed descriptions on the chosen security models and common use cases.</p> <p>This section presents these models and showcases the implications and benefits that they bring to the air cargo industry.</p> <ul> <li>Authentication (authn) has to do with identity: are you who you\u2019re claiming to be?</li> <li>Authorization (authz) has to do with policy: are you allowed to do the thing you\u2019re trying to do?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"API-Security/tools/unit-tests/","title":"Unit Test Suite","text":""},{"location":"API-Security/tools/unit-tests/#one-record-api-unit-test-suite","title":"ONE Record API Unit Test suite","text":"<p>ONE Record is the new IATA standard for data sharing and creates a single record view of the shipment.</p> <p>The ONE Record standard is highly technical and there is a risk that different parties interpret the specifications differently, which would lead to data quality issues and disruption of connectivity between different network players.\u00a0</p> <p>Due to this rationale, we construct a unit test suite with the aim of verifying that any implementation aligns with the API specifications.
