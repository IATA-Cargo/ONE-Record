The ONE Record standard allows parties to change or revoke these access rights to their data whenever they wish.</p> <p>Before an organization can access a LogisticsObject of another organization, it needs to be authorized to do so and the server that hosts the logistics objects will determine whether to grant access. Typically, when an participant creates a LogisticsObject and makes it available via its ONE Record API, the IoL participant will share the URI of that LogisticsObject with another IoL participant and grant them access by default.</p> <p>For example, a freight forwarder creates a Shipment, grants read access to an airline, and then sends the URI of the Logistics Object via a ONE Record Notification or other channel to the airline.</p> <p>It might happen that the Airline needs access to additional Logistics objects linked to the Shipment (i.e.: Piece). In this case, the Airline MAY request the access delegation directly from the freight forwarder (Example A1)</p> <p>At this point, only the forwarder and the airline can access this specific LogisticsObjects, but no one else.</p> <p>However, if a ground handling agent (GHA) also needs access to this logistics object, the airline MAY request an access delegation for the GHA (Example A2).</p> <p>If, as in this presented scenario, the airline already has a delegation of access to the logistics object, the concept of Trust Chains takes effect.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The party granting access is referred to as the <code>Delegator</code> and the party receiving access is the <code>Delegate</code>.  The party requesting access is referred to as the <code>Requestor</code>.</p> <p>Guidelines for Access Delegations in ONE Record:</p> <ul> <li>Only the Holder of a Logistics Object MAY delegate access to logistics objects.</li> <li>Any authenticated User of a Logistics Object CAN request a AccessDelegation on a Logistics Object, which result in a AccessDelegationRequest with the status REQUEST_PENDING.</li> <li>The implementer of the ONE record server MUST ensure that the requestor gets sufficient access to the resulting AccessDelegationRequest to query the status of the AccessDelegationRequest and revoke the AccessDelegationRequest (see also section on revoking Action Requests</li> <li>The Holder of a Logistics Object decides about the AccessDelegationRequest and changes the requestor's permissions to a Logistics Object unless there is a business or technical reason to reject it.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"API-Security/access-delegations/#request-access-delegation","title":"Request Access Delegation","text":""},{"location":"API-Security/access-delegations/#endpoint","title":"Endpoint","text":"<pre><code> POST {{baseURL}}/access-delegations\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"API-Security/access-delegations/#request","title":"Request","text":"<p>The following HTTP header parameters MUST be present in the request:</p> Header Description Examples Accept The content type that the ONE Record client wants the HTTP response to be formatted in. application/ld+json Content-Type The content type that is contained with the HTTP body.

Once created the Logistics Object is associated with a unique URI that makes the Logistics Object available on the network.</p> <p>Read a Logistics Object - Logistics Objects can be retrieved by calling the URI of that Logistics Object - its Logistics Object URI. Access rights to that Logistics Object URI is managed by the Holder of the Logistics Object.</p> <p>Update a Logistics Object - As a fundamental principle, only the Holder of a Logistics Object can make changes to it. Therefore, changes required by other parties are expressed as <code>Change Requests</code> that needs to be approved and executed by the actual holder.</p> <p>Verify a Logistics Object - The ONE Record standard enables third parties to not only propose modifications to LogisticsObjects but also flag anomalies, missing properties, or errors using a process called <code>Verification Request</code>. This action request follow the same approval process as the <code>Change Requests</code>.</p> <p>Subscribe to a Logistics Object for updates - Once a Logistics Object has been created, the holder can propose subscriptions to other parties who will then be notified of any changes. Other parties may also request such a subscription at the discretion of the holder.</p> <p>Create Logistics Event linked with Logistics Objects - Logistics Events like \"arrival\", \"acceptance\" etc. are central in the management of logistics and transport. Every participant in the network with sufficient access rights can submit any type of Logistics Event to any published Logistics Object.</p> <p>Read Logistics Event linked to a Logistics Object - Every participant of the network with sufficient permissions, can also query the Logistics Events associated with a Logistics Object.</p> <p>Manage access to a Logistics Object - Another fundamental principle of ONE Record is that only holders of Logistics Objects have fully control access rights to that Logistics Object. Therefore, only the holder of a Logistics Object can delegate permissions to users of the Logistics Object.</p> <p>Delegate access to a Logistics Object to a third party - By default, most Logistics Objects are not public accessible. Most of the time, access is granted to specific parties. Should these parties need to delegate access to further stakeholders - because they require data access to fulfil their logistics activities- then there is a mechanism for requesting such access to the holder of the Logistics Object.</p> <p>Manage and access versions of Logistics Objects - Each time a logistics object is updated by a change in data, this change is recorded in an audit trail. This automatically creates a new version of the Logistics Object. Each version of the logistics object SHOULD be found and retrieved.</p> <p>API security - Although not strictly an API feature, ONE Record specifies security measures for implementation on web servers such that access to the server may be identified, authenticated and authorized.</p>"},{"location":"API-Security/api-features/#api-endpoints","title":"API Endpoints","text":"HTTP Methods API Endpoint API Function GET / Retrieve ServerInformation POST /logistics-objects/ Create Logistics Object.

According to the RDF standard, a bNode can only be used as the subject or object of an RDF triple. When the object of a triple is a bNode, it means that the resource represented by the object has no URI, but still exists as a node in the RDF graph.</p> <p>bNodes are useful in creating RDF data that represents complex relationships between resources. bNodes are typically represented in RDF syntax with an identifier starting with an <code>_:</code> (underscore colon) followed by a unique identifier. For example: _:ded2e183. This allows to reference this bNode in several triples of the same RDF graph.</p> <p>In addition to logistics object types, the ONE Record data model ontology also specifies data classes that can be linked to logistics objects but do not have a publicly accessible URI (cf.

In this document, the ids of this embedded objects are called <code>embedded object ids</code> and can differ from Logistics Object URI. The structure of this embedded object id is up to the implementor of the ONE Record server.

Nevertheless, in ONE Record each node MUST have a unique <code>@id</code> within the document that does not change.  If stored in an RDF database/store, this <code>@id</code> MUST also have a global unique identifier within a graph.

However, only the <code>Holder of a LogisticsObject</code> can update the data,  while <code>Users of the LogisticsObject</code> can only request changes following a structure described in this section.</p> <p>Technically, the HTTP PATCH method is used to request an update to a LogisticsObject. According to the W3C HTTP standard, PATCH is used for partial changes to a resource. This differs from the HTTP PUT method, which is used for the complete replacement of a resource.</p> <p>Linked Data PATCH Format</p> <p>Although ONE Record API specification does not put much emphasis on the use of RDF, it is important that the specification of RDF is fully respected to ensure that ONE Record remains compatible with RDF technologies, such as the use of graph queries.</p> <p>W3C has developed the Linked Data PATCH Format for describing changes to Linked Data. It defines a list of operations to be performed against a Linked Data resource, namely the addition or removal of RDF triples in a graph representation of the resource.</p> <p>This Linked Data PATCH Format provides many options for updating RDF but since ONE Record uses JSON-LD as the RDF Serialization, the ONE Record API specification follows the JSON-LD PATCH specification and limits the options for changing Logistics Objects to two actions only: delete and add.</p> <p>The combination of delete and add is equivalent to replace. Thus, any property in a Logistics Object can be deleted, added, or replaced.</p> <p>Guidelines for updating Logistics Objects in ONE Record:</p> <ul> <li>Only the Holder of a Logistics Object MAY make the changes to logistics objects.</li> <li>Any authenticated User of a Logistics Object CAN request a Change on a Logistics Object, which result in a ChangeRequest with the status REQUEST_PENDING.</li> <li>The implementer of the ONE record server MUST ensure that the requester gets sufficient access to the resulting ChangeRequest to query the status of the ChangeRequest and to revoke pending ChangeRequests (see also section on revoking Action Requests)</li> <li>The Holder of a Logistics Object decides about the ChangeRequest and applies changes to a Logistics Object unless there is a business or technical reason to reject it.</li> <li>Evaluation and Application of a Change MUST occur as a single (atomic) event. Operations are sorted and processed as two groups of (1) delete operations and (2) add operations until all operations are applied, or else the entire update fails. If an error occurs, it is necessary to revert the logistics object back to its previous state before implementing the modification.</li> <li>If a field update fails, the entire Change is unsuccessful. Partial updates MUST NOT be accepted. The ONE Record server MUST use the property hasError of the ChangeRequest to document the errors.</li> <li>If the update is successful, the revision number in a Logistics Object's AuditTrail is incremented and the changes are recorded in the Audit Trail. Please refer to the sections on Historical Logistics Objects and Audit Trail of Logistics Objects for more details.</li> <li>It is RECOMMENDED to get the latest version of Logistics Object before requesting a Change to ensure that the update is made to the latest version of the Logistics Object.</li> <li>If a ChangeRequest is rejected by the Holder of the Logistics Object, the revision number of the Logistics Object is not incremented but the request is added to the AuditTrail of this Logistics Object, marked with the status REQUEST_REJECTED. A rejected ChangeRequest is kept in the AuditTrail of the Logistics Object.</li> <li>After a ChangeRequest is accepted, other pending ChangeRequests that affect the same revision MUST be rejected.</li> <li>The PATCH operation MUST NOT be used to create logistics objects; only linking to an existing object is allowed in a ChangeRequest. For this reason, the implementor must validate that the subject of each operation is either the target logistics object or an embedded object.</li> <li>The PATCH operation MUST NOT be used to link a LogisticsEvent to a Logistics Object. The ONE Record server MUST reject requested changes that contain operations to the hasLogisticsEvent property.</li> <li>The ONE Record server MUST check that the property hasLogisticsObject matches the URI/endpoint used for the PATCH request. </li> <li>If datatype in OperationObject is an IRI of the ONE Record cargo ontology and is not a data class that inherits from LogisticsObject, then the ONE Record Server MUST generate an embeddedObjectId for the object in the <code>value</code> property of <code>OperationObject</code> (see section about Blank Nodes and Embedded Objects)</li> </ul> <p>Logistics Objects MUST have a revision number, which is a non negative integer to be incremented after every applied change. The audit trail contains a field latestRevision which defines the latest revision of the Logistics Object.</p>"},{"location":"API-Security/logistics-objects/#endpoint_2","title":"Endpoint","text":"<pre><code> PATCH {{baseURL}}/logistics-objects/{{logisticsObjectId}}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"API-Security/logistics-objects/#request_2","title":"Request","text":"<p>The following HTTP header parameters MUST be present in the PATCH request:</p> Request Header Description Examples Accept The content type that you want the HTTP response to be formatted in. application/ld+json Content-Type The content type that is contained with the HTTP body. application/ld+json <p>The HTTP request body must contain a valid Change object in the format as specified by the Content-Type in the header.</p> <p>The Change is a data class of the ONE Record API ontology.

The \"Implicit\" grant type is suitable for browser-based applications, providing access tokens directly, while the \"Client Credentials\" grant type is employed by confidential clients to authenticate themselves and obtain access tokens directly from the authorization server.

It works by establishing a secure, encrypted connection between the client and server, which is authenticated using digital certificates.</p> <p>Without TLS, a third party could intercept and read sensitive information such as API credentials and private data as it is transmitted.

Most data classically found in the AWB are essential parts of the Booking Option and Booking Option Request as well as the Piece and Shipment objects. As those LOs are created earlier in the logical chain, the data in the booking process is in the lead and referred to in the AWB. Data like WAYBILL_NUMBER, the total gross weight, the origin and destination, or the number of pieces originate from the Booking, not the AWB. Additionally, some information is not required anymore, especially the total-fields, as the mechanism to be used in ONE Record would be to count the correlated items themselves.</p> <p>Secondly: Mark outdated data fields clearly as deprecated. All the data fields found under the WayBill Lane in the cIMP/cXML data catalogue are considered to be outdated, especially the IATA Rates. The whole architecture of these fields, presenting characteristics of groups of pieces, is already not supported by most carriers nowadays. Additionally, the structure of this LO is not compatible with the principles of ONE Record.</p> <p>Thirdly: Remove all data fields that have no legal impact on the AWB. A lot of information was traditionally part of the AWB, as the AWB used to be the major \u2013 and often exclusive \u2013 source of information on the shipment. With ONE Record, any data can shared in correlation with the AWB number or any other unique ID, but then don\u2019t have to be part of the AWB. This mostly effects fields like the accounting information, the airline product names and codes, or the insurance information. Also, parts of the other charges section not be part of the contract between forwarder and carrier, as the add up during the execution of the AWB.</p> <p>Fourthly: All physical characteristics of the totality of pieces under one contract can be found in the Shipment LO. This does not include piece-related information, as they are characteristics of pieces themselves, but physical characteristics that are shared by all pieces under that contract.
