# Welcome to ONE Record Standard Specifications!

This repository contains the specifications and ontology of ONE Record Standard.

## What is ONE Record?

The vision for ONE Record is an end-to-end digital logistics and transport supply chain where data is easily and transparently exchanged in a digital ecosystem of air cargo stakeholders, communities and data platforms.

ONE Record is a standard for data sharing and creates a single record view of the shipment. This standard defines a common data model for the data that is shared via standardized and secured web API.

You can find further information about ONE Record standard on the [IATA dedicated webpage](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/cargo/e/one-record/) and on the [ONE Record Developer Portal](https://onerecord.iata.org/).
