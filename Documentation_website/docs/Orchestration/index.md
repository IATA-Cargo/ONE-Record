# Introduction
The Data Orchestration is a work that was intitiated in September 2023, under COTB and DCWG governance. Industry stakeholders (Airline, Freight Forwarders, IT Service Providers, Cargo iQ) have worked to propose a way to use the ONE Record standard to support the operations and business processes.

## Objectives
As a response to the industry for guidance with ONE Record, we figured the Data Orchestration is the answer to make the link between processes and ONE Record standard. It includes:

* Review of the Industry and Cargo iQ Master Operating Plans (MOP)
* Identification of key industry use cases
* Identification of ONE Record workflow that supports the processes and use cases
* Provide tools to check compliance with the standard and illustrate the Data Orchestration

## Version
Current version of the Orchestration is **1.1.0**.

## General notes

1. The use cases covered by the Orchestration need to be generic or standard enough to make sense for the industry. Company-specific processes cannot be part of the Orchestration documentation although IATA is there to support stakeholders in their implementation of ONE Record.
2. While the MOP is a standardized process, each company may have implemented it differently, whether it's modification in some of the steps or even in their sequence. the Orchestration can only cover the standardized scope of the MOP at a high level.
3. We highly recommend stakeholders to share their good practice with the Industry when it seems relevant.

## Industry Good Practice

We will list Good Practice documentation shared by stakeholders.
