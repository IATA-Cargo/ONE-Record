# Purpose

The Orchestration's purpose is not to cover all possible use cases within the industry as there are endless variations of processes. Nevertheless we will try to cover use cases that are generic and standard enough to be relevant for all stakeholders. Many will require subtle adjustments based on their own operational processes but the foundation shall remain the same.

# Scope

This section focuses on use cases that are more specific than the processes covered by the MOP. It includes processes derived from business requirements linked to IATA CSC Resolutions or Recommended Practices.
