ONE Record is an industry standard and follows a proper governance established by IATA with industry stakeholders. Effective governance ensures the model remains robust, up-to-date, and aligned with industry needs.

The content of ONE Record standard constitutes the Attachment 'A' of CSC Recommended Practice (RP) 1690 "INTERNET BASED CARGO DATA SHARING STANDARDS".

# IATA and Industry Governance

As a CSC Recommended Practice the ONE Record standard follows CSC governance. The Cargo Operations and Technology Board (COTB) has authority for adoption of amendments to the RP. This means that all changes to the standard will be proposed to the COTB that will be requested to vote.

Under COTB there are 2 taskforces responsible for the development of the standard:

- `The ONE Record Data Model taskforce` manages the Data Model and all linked resources, including the Orchestration.
- `The ONE Record API & Security taskforce` manages the API & Security specifications.

# Recommended Practice 1695

As of July 2025 The CSC has officially adopted Recommended Practice 1695:

!!! note
    Effective 1 January 2026, ONE Record (as defined in the Recommended Practice 1690) is the preferred IATA standard for data sharing among all air cargo stakeholders, including but not limited to freight forwarders, carriers, ground handling agents and IT solution providers.

This represents a major milestone for ONE Record and for the transition from EDI to Data Sharing.
    
# Standard release lifecycle

ONE Record is an industry standard that is bound to evolve and improve. While there is no specific timeline for ONE Record standard releases, up till now the taskforces aimed at yearly releases.

The objective is that current release becomes the next stable version for the industry, however changes can always occur for:

- Bugfixing
- Evolution of regulatory requirements (Governments, Customs, etc.)
- Evolution of IATA Regulations requiring changes of the standard (DGR, LAR, etc.)
- Improvements as a result of feedback from live implementations of ONE Record

While this list is not exhaustive it is representative of the reasons why the standard will evolve in the future.
