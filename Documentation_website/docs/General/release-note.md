# General comments

This release of ONE Record standards is the outcome of all the work carried out in 2025 and early 2026 by the various working groups involved in the maintenance and improvement of the standard. It includes the API & Security working group, the Data Model working group, the Data Orchestration Working group and all the ad-hoc sub-groups. Feedbacks from ONE Record hackathons have been a very valuable source of improvements as well as the different pilots and live implementations of ONE Record.

We believe this release, as the previous one, is production-ready.

The working groups mentioned above are still actively operating and all feedbacks and inputs will be highly appreciated to help us improve further the standard.
