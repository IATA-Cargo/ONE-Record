# IATA tools

While defining the ONE Record standard, it came as an evidence that some tools were required to support the specifications.

## Ontology

Ontologies are ttl file describing all classes, data properties and how all of these are linked. Within ONE Record specifications we have a core, a code list and an API ontology. There are multiple ways to "display" the ontology apart from a plain text file.

### Ontology - Data Model

- The simplest representation provides a very simple view of all classes and properties: [https://onerecord.iata.org/ns/cargo/index-en.html](https://onerecord.iata.org/ns/cargo/index-en.html)
- We developed the Ontology Visualizer to replace old pdf versions of the ontology: [Ontology Visualizer](*/ontology-visualizer.md)

### Ontology - API

- Similarly to the Data Model, we also have a simple representation of the API ontology: [https://onerecord.iata.org/ns/api/index-en.html](https://onerecord.iata.org/ns/api/index-en.html)
- Swagger API documentation: [https://onerecord.iata.org/swagger-ui.html](https://onerecord.iata.org/swagger-ui.html)

# Third party tools

We rely also on third party tools that are usually open-source and are a great fit for our needs.

- `Protege` is an open-source ontology editor published by Stanford University: [https://protege.stanford.edu/](https://protege.stanford.edu/).
