ONE Record data model has been designed based on technical requirements on one hand (moving from an EDI landscape to data sharing) and on business requirements on the other hand.

This part focuses on Business requirements that come from various sources:
- IATA CSC Resolutions and Recommended Practices as published in the IATA CSC Resolutions Manual (including standards and regulations)
- IATA Working group specific outcomes that fall under IATA Boards governance

In order to ensure ONE Record compliance with business requirements we have analyzed the existing documentation and proposed an approach to use ONE Record to convey relevant information.
