# Introduction
The Consignment Security Declaration (CSD) is a mandatory requirement that is defined by ICAO Annex 17 and ICAO Aviation Security Manual Doc. 8973. IATA defines the electronic-CSD (e-CSD) according to ICAO requirements in the CSC Resolution 651.

# Requirements
The e-CSD requirements follow the initial paper document CSD with a set of 15 different data fields to provide. More details can be found on iata.org dedicated page here: [https://www.iata.org/en/programs/security/cargo-security/csd/](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/security/cargo-security/csd/)

In particular, the CSD layout is available on iata.org webiste [https://www.iata.org/contentassets/4bb3450ef9a2447493a132b38fac1d26/e-consignment-security-declaration.pdf](here).

# Chosen approach
In legacy messaging standards (CIMP and CXML) the eCSD data is provided through the OCI grouping and guidelines are provided in the OCI Composition Rules Table.

With ONE Record, our objective is to avoid using OCI as a dumping place to provide Security and Customs information. The `SecurityDeclaration` object has been created to provide most fo the e-CSD information and has the following structure:
