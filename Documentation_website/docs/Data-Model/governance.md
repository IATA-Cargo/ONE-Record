ONE Record is an industry standard and follows a proper governance established by IATA with industry stakeholders.
Effective governance ensures the model remains robust, up-to-date, and aligned with industry needs.

#  Community Involvement
The ONE Record model is governed with transparency and inclusiveness:

- Industry participants can **contribute via GitHub**, where the data model is publicly hosted. Issues can be created and will be then assessed with the ONE REcord Data Model dedicated taskforce.
- Open discussions and collaborative documentation foster innovation and ensure practical applicability.

The GitHub dashboard can be found on the following page: https://github.com/users/IATA-Cargo/projects/2/views/1

# Change Management Process
A simple change request process is in place to propose updates or extensions to the model:

- Stakeholders (e.g., airlines, freight forwarders, tech providers) submit proposals.
- Each proposal undergoes a review by domain experts and relevant working groups.
- Approved changes are integrated into official releases, typically on an annual cycle.

 # Versioning and Backward Compatibility
Each release of the data model follows **semantic versioning**, ensuring clarity between major, minor, and patch updates.

Backward compatibility is prioritized to maintain stability across systems but it cannot always be ensured as we can introduce breaking changes.
