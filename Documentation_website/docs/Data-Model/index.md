# Purpose

This ONE Record data model specification is part of the ONE Record standard.
It details core concepts of the data model described in the ONE Record cargo and ONE Record core code lists ontologies.
It aims to provide explanations and examples for usage of the data model for implementers.

# Prerequisites

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with air cargo vocabulary and the concept of linked data.
