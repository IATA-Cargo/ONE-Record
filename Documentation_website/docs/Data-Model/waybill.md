# Requirements
The *paper* Air Waybill requirements are described in the Cargo Services Conference Resolutions Manual (CSCRM) in Resolution 600a. Especially all boxes of the paper Waybill are identified with guidelines and rules to fill in the requested information.

From an *electronic* perspective the Air Waybill relies on (deprecated) Cargo-IMP FWB message and Cargo-XML XFWB message. Discrepancies exist between FWB and XFWB essentially because Cargo-IMP was discontinued in 2014 - Context has evolved and XML doesn't have same technical restrictions as Cargo-IMP.

# Chosen approach
Approach needs to be two-fold:
- Firstly we take into account the *paper* requirements, this leads to a mapping that is presented below.
- Secondly the *electronic* requirements lead to a mapping that has been done between XFWB and ONE Record in the corresponding section in the Data Orchestration tab [link]

While data can change at its source (e.g. shipment being reweighted), 2 API specific features allow to re-create the equivalent of a paper Waybill using the mapping above with the right data:
- The Audit trail ensures that all changes to data is tracked and properly identified
- One can retrieve data using a specific timestamp (for instance equivalent to RCS event or the Waybill ready event) to have the data that was agreed upon at that time


# Data model

Naturally the `Waybill` object is at the center of the data model when the Air Waybill is concerned, whether we refer to the *paper* or *electronic* waybill.

The `WaybillLineItem` object is also necessary, linked to `Waybill` object, to properly record the information at Air Waybill level. The line items as used in the Air Waybill cannot always be linked to actual `Piece` objects as the level of information required does not always reflect the physical goods. This is because we can have discrepancy between actual goods transported and rates as they are defined.

Also it is possible that all accurate piece details are available at the the Waybill.

Further details can be found in the dedicated page for [XFWB Mapping](./Orchestration/xfwb.md).
