A Notification of Amendment (NoA) will be issued to all Members of IATA and to the Cargo Services Conference Accredited Representatives and Alternates. Any IATA Member may, within 30 days after the circulation of the NoA, protest these amendments by informing the Cargo Services Conference Secretary with specific reasons for the protest. If no protests are received within this timeframe, the proposed amendments will become effective.
