# Accelerating ONE Record Implementation in the Air Cargo Industry
Welcome to our centralized repository dedicated to tracking the progress of ONE Record implementation across the air cargo industry. We recognize the critical importance of transparency, collaboration, and knowledge sharing in driving digital transformation within our industry.
## Our Approach
In our pursuit of advancing the adoption of the ONE Record standard, we have devised a structured approach to facilitate collaboration among stakeholders. We believe that by sharing information on implementation progress, challenges, and best practices, we can collectively accelerate the transition to a more connected and efficient air cargo ecosystem.
## Kanban Board
We utilize a Kanban board to visualize and track the progress of our projects. Each project is represented by an issue card that moves through different stages as it progresses. Our Kanban board is structured to reflect the following steps:
1.	Exploration/ PoC: Initial exploration and Proof of Concept (PoC) phase to validate the feasibility and potential of the ONE Record standard.
2.	IATA Unit Test: Conducting unit tests specific to IATA standards to ensure compliance and technical integrity of the ONE Record standard.
3.	IATA Integration Test: Integration testing to verify seamless interoperability of the ONE Record standard with other systems and platforms within the IATA ecosystem.
4.	E2E Pilot Project: Transitioning to an end-to-end pilot project for comprehensive testing and validation of the ONE Record standard across the entire supply chain.
5.	Live Production: Moving to live production, signifying the readiness of the ONE Record standard for widespread adoption and deployment.
## Why You Should Participate
We invite all stakeholders involved in ONE Record implementation projects to contribute to this Kanban board. Whether you're an airline, freight forwarder, ground handler, customs authority, technology provider, or any stakeholders involved in the air cargo chain, your insights and experiences are invaluable to the success of this endeavor. By participating in this collaborative effort, you can:
-	Gain visibility into the progress of other organizations.
-	Identify potential implementation partners and collaboration opportunities.
-	Share lessons learned, best practices, and resources.
-	Contribute to the collective knowledge base of the air cargo industry.
## How To Contribute
### Step 1: Navigate to the GitHub Repository
1.	Open your web browser and go to the GitHub repository for the ONE-Record-Adoption project: https://github.com/IATA-Cargo/ONE-Record-Adoption
2.	Click on the "Issues" tab in the repository's navigation menu.
### Step 2: Create a New Issue

3.	Click on the green "New issue" button.
4.	From the “ONE Record Project Card Template”, click on the green “Get started” button.
5.	Fill in the different fields to provide detailed information about the project, including any relevant context, requirements, or specifications. The following elements are part of the provided template:
- Title: Briefly summarize the issue or project.
- Project Objective: Clearly state the main goal or purpose of the project.
- Use Case Objective: Specify the intended use case or scenario for the project.
- Project Phase: Select the appropriate phase from the following options: Exploration/PoC, IATA Unit Test, IATA Integration Test, E2E Pilot Project, Live Production.
- Start Date: Enter the planned start date for the project.
- End Date: Enter the planned end date for the project.
- Accountable Person: Identify the individual responsible for the project's execution.
- Company Information: List all relevant company names and their respective representatives involved in the project. You can also specify their respective role/contribution in the project.
- Standard Version: Specify the version of ONE Record standard being used.
- ONE Record Data Model: Check the box to indicate which data model elements are being utilized for the project.
- ONE Record API Features: Check the box to indicate which API features are being implemented for the project.
- Lessons Learned: Use this section to document any lessons learned, challenges faced, outcomes achieved, questions arising, or other relevant information throughout the project lifecycle.
6.	Optionally, you can use Markdown formatting to enhance the readability of your project description by adding headers, lists, links, etc.

### Step 3: Track the Project on the Kanban Board

7.	After creating the project, IATA will be able to pin your project card onto the Kanban Board.
8.	Go to the GitHub repository for the ONE-Record-Adoption project: https://github.com/IATA-Cargo/ONE-Record-Adoption.
9.	Navigate to the repository's Kanban board by clicking on the "Projects" tab in the repository's navigation menu and selecting the relevant project board (e.g., " ONE Record Adoption ").
10.	Locate the newly created Project card in one of the columns of the Kanban board. The Project card will display all the information of the project as previously captured.
11.	To move the issue card to a different column on the Kanban board, simply drag and drop the card to the desired column. Note: you can only move the cards you have created.
### Step 4: Collaborate and Update the Project card
12.	You can update the Project card by adding comments, providing updates, or asking questions directly on the issue page.
13.	To update the status or progress of the Project card on the Kanban board, the card creator can move the issue card to the appropriate column as work progresses.
By following these steps, you can effectively create new projects in the GitHub repository's Kanban board and track their progress as part of the project development and adoption process.
